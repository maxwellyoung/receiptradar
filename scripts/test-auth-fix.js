console.log("🔐 Authentication Fix Applied!");
console.log("\n✅ What Was Fixed:");
console.log("1. Added user authentication check before processing");
console.log("2. Clear error message when user is not signed in");
console.log("3. Prevents database errors from invalid user IDs");
console.log("4. Better user experience with helpful error message");

console.log("\n🎯 The Issue Was:");
console.log("- App was trying to create receipts with empty user ID");
console.log("- Database rejected the request due to foreign key constraint");
console.log("- User wasn't getting clear feedback about the problem");

console.log("\n🔧 The Fix:");
console.log("- Check if user is authenticated before processing");
console.log("- Show clear message: 'Please sign in to save receipts'");
console.log("- Allow users to still view scan results without saving");
console.log("- Prevent database errors from occurring");

console.log("\n📱 Test Your App:");
console.log("1. Try processing without signing in");
console.log("2. You should see: 'Please sign in to save receipts'");
console.log("3. Sign in and try again - should work!");
console.log("4. Receipts should save successfully when authenticated");

console.log("\n🚀 The 'Failed to save receipt' error should now be resolved!");
