# Competitive Advantage Component Integration

## Overview

The `CompetitiveAdvantage` component highlights ReceiptRadar's unique benefits over web-based price comparison sites like GroSave. This guide shows how to integrate it into existing screens.

## Component Usage

### Basic Integration

```typescript
import { CompetitiveAdvantage } from "@/components/CompetitiveAdvantage";

// Simple usage with default title
<CompetitiveAdvantage />

// Custom title
<CompetitiveAdvantage title="Why Choose ReceiptRadar?" />

// Show detailed benefits
<CompetitiveAdvantage showDetails={true} />
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Onboarding Screen

**Location**: `app/onboarding.tsx`
**Purpose**: Introduce competitive advantages during first-time user experience

```typescript
// Add after the main onboarding content
<CompetitiveAdvantage
  title="Why ReceiptRadar is Different"
  showDetails={false}
/>
```

### 2. Price Comparison Screen

**Location**: `app/(tabs)/price-compare.tsx`
**Purpose**: Reinforce advantages when users are comparing prices

```typescript
// Add as a collapsible section or modal
const [showAdvantages, setShowAdvantages] = useState(false);

// In the render method
{
  showAdvantages && (
    <CompetitiveAdvantage
      title="Why Our Prices Are More Accurate"
      showDetails={true}
    />
  );
}
```

### 3. Settings Screen

**Location**: `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`
**Purpose**: Provide detailed information about app benefits

```typescript
// Add as a dedicated section
<View style={styles.section}>
  <Text variant="titleMedium">About ReceiptRadar</Text>
  <CompetitiveAdvantage showDetails={true} />
</View>
```

### 4. Landing Page

**Location**: `public/landing.html`
**Purpose**: Convert visitors by highlighting advantages

```html
<!-- Add to the features section -->
<div class="competitive-advantage">
  <h2>Why ReceiptRadar is Different</h2>
  <!-- Convert React component to HTML/CSS -->
</div>
```

## Customization Options

### Theme Integration

The component automatically uses your app's theme colors and typography:

```typescript
// Colors are automatically applied from theme
const theme = useTheme<AppTheme>();
// Component uses: theme.colors.primary, theme.colors.surface, etc.
```

### Animation Control

The component uses Moti for animations. You can customize:

```typescript
// Disable animations (if needed)
<CompetitiveAdvantage
  title="Static Version"
  // Add animation prop if needed
/>
```

### Content Customization

To modify the advantages list, edit the component:

```typescript
const advantages = [
  {
    icon: "receipt",
    title: "Receipt-Based Intelligence",
    description: "Real prices from actual receipts, not web scraping",
    benefit: "99% accuracy vs 70% on web-based sites",
  },
  // Add more advantages or modify existing ones
];
```

## Marketing Integration

### A/B Testing

Test different advantage presentations:

```typescript
// Version A: Simple list
<CompetitiveAdvantage showDetails={false} />

// Version B: Detailed benefits
<CompetitiveAdvantage showDetails={true} />

// Version C: Custom title
<CompetitiveAdvantage title="Beat GroSave with Real Data" />
```

### Analytics Tracking

Track how users interact with the component:

```typescript
// Add analytics tracking
const handleAdvantageView = () => {
  analytics.track("competitive_advantage_viewed", {
    screen: "price_compare",
    showDetails: true,
  });
};
```

## Performance Considerations

### Lazy Loading

Load the component only when needed:

```typescript
const CompetitiveAdvantage = React.lazy(
  () => import("@/components/CompetitiveAdvantage")
);

// Wrap in Suspense
<Suspense fallback={<ActivityIndicator />}>
  <CompetitiveAdvantage />
</Suspense>;
```

### Conditional Rendering

Show only to new users or when relevant:

```typescript
const { user } = useAuthContext();
const isNewUser = user?.created_at > Date.now() - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;

{
  isNewUser && <CompetitiveAdvantage />;
}
```

## Content Strategy

### Messaging Hierarchy

1. **Primary**: Receipt-based accuracy
2. **Secondary**: Real-time updates
3. **Tertiary**: Personal history
4. **Quaternary**: Household features

### Competitive Keywords

- "receipt-based" vs "web scraping"
- "real-time" vs "delayed updates"
- "personal" vs "generic"
- "accurate" vs "approximate"

### Call-to-Action Integration

Add CTAs after the advantages:

```typescript
<CompetitiveAdvantage />
<Button
  mode="contained"
  onPress={() => navigation.navigate('camera')}
>
  Start Scanning Receipts
</Button>
```
