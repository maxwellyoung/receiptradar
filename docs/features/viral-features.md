# 🚀 Viral-Bait Visual Hooks for ReceiptRadar

## Overview

ReceiptRadar now includes three viral-bait visual hooks designed to make grocery tracking fun, shareable, and engaging. These features transform mundane receipt scanning into delightful, social media-worthy moments.

## 🦕 Receipt Critters

**What it does:** Every scan spawns a random low-poly mascot whose size reflects total spend, with bulging eyes when snacks spike.

**How it works:**

- Critter size = `Math.min(Math.max(totalSpend / 10, 60), 120)` pixels
- Eyes bulge when snacks > 25% of total spend
- 5 different critter types: Spendosaurus, Budget Bunny, Savings Sloth, Receipt Raccoon, Grocery Giraffe
- Continuous bounce animation with spring physics
- Tap to share (ready for GIF export)

**Viral potential:** Tiny Tamagotchi vibes → screenshottable, meme-ready content

## 🎉 Confetti Barcode Rain

**What it does:** After a "big save" (>$10), the screen rains animated barcodes that morph into dollar signs with haptic feedback.

**How it works:**

- Triggers when `savingsAmount > 10`
- Particle count = `Math.min(Math.floor(savingsAmount / 5), 20)`
- Barcodes (▌▐█▄▀░▒▓) morph into money symbols ($💵💰💸)
- Haptic success feedback on iOS/Android
- 3-second animation with fade-out

**Viral potential:** Dopamine + screencap moment = tweet fodder

## 🌈 Grocery Aura Gradient

**What it does:** Generates a radial gradient from category mix and creates shareable aesthetic cards.

**How it works:**

- Category colors: Fresh Produce (green), Meat (red), Snacks (orange), etc.
- Gradient intensity based on total spend
- Aura rings with opacity based on spend intensity
- Export as 1080×1080 PNG for social media
- One-tap share with pre-written caption

**Viral potential:** Instant aesthetic, no private numbers shown
