## Technical Implementation

### Receipt Parser Development

```typescript
// New parser structure
interface WellingtonStoreParser extends IReceiptParser {
  storeName: string;
  location: string;
  receiptFormat: ReceiptFormat;
  specialFeatures: string[];
}

// Example: Moore Wilson's parser
class MooreWilsonsParser implements WellingtonStoreParser {
  storeName = "Moore Wilson's Fresh";
  location = "Wellington CBD";
  receiptFormat = ReceiptFormat.STANDARD;
  specialFeatures = ["gourmet", "fresh-produce", "premium"];

  parseReceipt(receiptText: string): ParsedReceipt {
    // Implementation for Moore Wilson's specific format
  }
}
```

### Database Schema Updates

```sql
-- Add Wellington-specific store categories
ALTER TABLE stores ADD COLUMN category VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE stores ADD COLUMN region VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE stores ADD COLUMN specialty_features TEXT[];

-- Insert Wellington stores
INSERT INTO stores (name, category, region, specialty_features) VALUES
('Moore Wilson''s Fresh', 'independent', 'wellington', ARRAY['gourmet', 'fresh-produce']),
('Harbour City Market', 'market', 'wellington', ARRAY['local', 'fresh-produce']),
('Huckleberry', 'health-food', 'wellington', ARRAY['organic', 'health-foods']),
('Yan''s Supermarket', 'asian', 'wellington', ARRAY['asian-grocery', 'imported']);
```

### Price Comparison Enhancements

```typescript
// Enhanced price comparison for Wellington stores
interface WellingtonPriceComparison extends PriceComparison {
  storeCategory: string;
  specialtyFeatures: string[];
  localSourcing: boolean;
  organicCertified: boolean;
}

// Store-specific price insights
interface StoreInsights {
  storeName: string;
  category: string;
  priceRange: "budget" | "mid-range" | "premium";
  specialtyAreas: string[];
  localSourcing: boolean;
}
```
