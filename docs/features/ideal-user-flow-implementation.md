# Ideal User Flow Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

This document outlines the implementation of ReceiptRadar's ideal user flow, designed to balance instant insight with delight, zero friction, and empathy for cost-of-living stress. The flow is retention-oriented and tailored to provide a sharp, engaging experience.

## 🌀 Core User Flow

### 1. Onboarding Experience

**Component**: `EnhancedOnboardingScreen`

**Features**:

- **Fast, fun entry**: Cute animated worm (RadarWorm) greets users
- **Tone mode selection**:
  - 🐣 **Gentle Mode** ("Be kind to me") - Supportive, encouraging feedback
  - 🔥 **Hard Mode** ("Give it to me straight") - Direct, honest feedback
- **One-liner**: "We'll help you track groceries, spot waste, and save."
- **Permission request**: Camera access for receipt scanning
- **Optional sign-in**: Email/Supabase magic link integration

**Implementation Details**:

```typescript
// Tone mode selection with haptic feedback
const handleToneModeSelect = async (mode: ToneMode) => {
  Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light);
  setToneMode(mode);
  await AsyncStorage.setItem("@toneMode", mode);
  setCurrentStep(1);
};
```

### 2. Core Receipt Scanning Loop

**Component**: `ReceiptScanningExperience`

**Simple loop that users can repeat weekly with minimal effort**:

#### A. 📸 Scan Receipt

- Tap worm → camera opens instantly
- Auto-crop & scan → show receipt total + list
- AI extracts: date, store, item names, quantities, prices
- Tags items (e.g., dairy, snack, bulk)
- Links to known price history

#### B. 🧠 Insight & Reaction

- "You spent $132.74"
- "Could've saved $11.20 by switching stores"
- Price over time for key items (milk, cheese, bread)
- Store comparison or alternative alerts
- Mood worm reacts: 😐😢😈 depending on tone mode

#### C. 💌 Save & Share

- Option to "save to week" (auto categorized by date)
- Auto-screenshare: "My receipt reality this week 😭"
- 🐛 Worm says: "Next week, we hunt better deals."

**Implementation Details**:

```typescript
// Dynamic worm mood based on spending and tone mode
const updateWormMood = (totalSpent: number, insights: ReceiptInsight[]) => {
  let newMood = "calm";
  let message = "";

  if (totalSpent < 30) {
    newMood = toneMode === "gentle" ? "zen" : "calm";
    message =
      toneMode === "gentle"
        ? "A modest day of consumption. The worm approves! 🌱"
        : "Not bad. Could be worse.";
  }
  // ... more mood logic
};
```

### 3. Weekly Insights & Retention

**Component**: `WeeklyWormDigest`

**Features**:

- **Weekly worm digest** with personalized insights
- **Smart insights**: "You're buying 1.5x more snacks this month"
- **Savings opportunities**: "Cheese is up 12% this month"
- **Store recommendations**: "Coke is cheapest at Pak'nSave now"
- **Optional notifications**: New price drops, trends
- **Fun challenges**: "Challenge: try a $50 grocery shop week"

**Implementation Details**:

```typescript
// Weekly challenge generation
const challenges = [
  "Try a $50 grocery shop this week",
  "Buy only store brands for one shopping trip",
  "Plan meals for the entire week before shopping",
  "Use only cash for grocery shopping",
];

const randomChallenge =
  challenges[Math.floor(Math.random() * challenges.length)];
```

```typescript
const { receipts, createReceipt, loading } = useReceipts(userId);
```

**Radar Mood**: `useRadarMood`

```typescript
const { mood, message, showSpeechBubble } = useRadarMood({

});
```

### Animation System

**Entrance Animations**:

```typescript
const animateEntrance = () => {
  Animated.parallel([
    Animated.timing(fadeAnim, { toValue: 1, duration: 800 }),
    Animated.spring(slideAnim, { toValue: 0, tension: 100, friction: 8 }),
    Animated.spring(scaleAnim, { toValue: 1, tension: 100, friction: 8 }),
  ]).start();
};
```

**Haptic Feedback**:

```typescript
// Light feedback for selections
Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light);

// Medium feedback for actions
Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Medium);
