# Email Confirmation UI System

## 🎯 Overview

The app now includes a complete email confirmation flow that handles users who sign up but haven't verified their email address yet. This provides a smooth user experience and clear guidance on what to do next.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The email confirmation screen follows the same refined, minimalist aesthetic as the authentication screen, inspired by design legends like Jony Ive, Dieter Rams, and others:

- **Clarity**: Clear instructions with numbered steps
- **Deference**: Subtle animations and focus states
- **Depth**: Layered visual hierarchy with proper spacing
- **Honesty**: Clear feedback on what's happening

## 🔄 Flow Overview

```
User Signs Up → Email Confirmation Screen → User Confirms Email → Main App
     ↓
Back to Sign In ← Resend Email ← Check Confirmation Status
```

### Automatic Detection
